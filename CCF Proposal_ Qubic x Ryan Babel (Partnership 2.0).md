**CCF Proposal Qubic X Ryan Babel**

Send 15.2 billion QUBIC to the identity: 

BIALNVSDAWDXUCOVZALXDHDTONNBLVVSPVMWGKUTLCAPNUQMCKJANYFCLMZM 

to support marketing efforts by Ryan Babel. 

Option 0: no   
Option 1: yes, 15.2 billion QUBIC 

**Note:** This CCF proposal is part of a 3-layered proposal. The current request covers the second and third phase, with Part 2 covering July and Part 3 for August. Each phase builds on the previous one, allowing for progress evaluation and alignment before proceeding. The total amount across all three phases will be **22.8 billion QUBIC**.

---

It’s hard to believe, but the first month of our 3-month partnership has already passed. During the formation of this collaboration, I became aware through community feedback and my own research that Qubic previously had a negative experience with a YouTuber/KOL. This affected not only the team’s trust, but also the wider community’s confidence in external partnerships.

To help rebuild that trust, I made it clear that I wasn’t joining Qubic to make a quick buck. I focused on showing results through action. Since trust had been broken in the past, it was important that this deal worked for both parties. I spoke with team members, listened closely to the community’s concerns, and offered flexibility:

* A lower entry price

* The ability to cancel at any time during the first month

* And a commitment to only move forward if the collaboration truly added value

I’m glad to say the first month went great. The community responded positively, and there has been no indication of dissatisfaction. In fact, I’ve already done more than we initially agreed on including launching the Telegram Raid Group, which has proven far more effective than the original Discord-based raids. I personally believe this partnership between me and Qubic has had a great start. I’m working hard with the connections I have to give my maximum but this takes time obviously. I feel strong momentum right now and I want to keep going.

During the drama on X, I received a ton of messages asking if I was going to sell all my tokens — but I’m confident in Qubic, and I’ve seen that the community is truly enthusiastic that said Talentnodes helped me to understand the situation much better. I’m also requesting the funding for both remaining months at once, so I don’t have to submit a third proposal later. This does take time, and I trust the Qubic community. After the third month, we can align our visions and explore a new proposal but let’s not frontrun that now. 

📊 **Post Performance Overview**

Over the past 4 weeks, I’ve been actively posting about Qubic to help grow awareness and engagement around the project. In this document I will give a quick breakdown of the performance of those posts, highlights the community traction so far, and show how the momentum is being amplified through the Telegram raid group.

| Date | Impressions | Comments | Retweets | Likes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 16 Jun | 37,000 | 89 | 184 | 579 |
| 18 Jun | 22,000 | 19 | 28 | 236 |
| 26 Jun | 54,000 | 95 | 215 | 542 |
| 4 Jul | 19,000 | 24 | 106 | 387 |
| 10 Jul | 14,000 | 19 | 106 | 300 |
| **TOTAL** | **146,000+** | **246** | **639** | **2,044** |

The Qubic posts I’ve shared on my crypto page have generated over 146,000 impressions, 600+ retweets, and 2,000+ likes. A clear signal that this content is gaining traction on crypto Twitter and resonating with a broader, engaged audience beyond the core community. The numbers show that there’s a strong audience reacting to Qubic-related content when it’s presented authentically and consistently. Engagement is not just passive; the community is commenting, sharing, and showing up. And with the market waking up, I believe these numbers will only continue to grow. All in the benefit of Qubic. 

**Community Activation**  
To build on this momentum, I’ve launched a Telegram raid group to involve the community more directly. The goal is to create energy around every post and increase visibility for Qubic across the space. We’re encouraging more members to take part not just in reposting, but in starting conversations and bringing in new eyes. We currently have 138 members, and I’m aiming to grow this to a minimum of 300 active members. I believe this is very achievable as interest continues to build and more people recognize the potential of Qubic. I also highlighted the importance of the Telegram group and its growth in my first proposal that was shared.

**Collaborators**  
Special thanks to @rudynakamoto and @m4r71n\_4r7 for their consistent support in helping shape the narrative and visuals behind the content. Their creativity, eye for quality, and ability to translate ideas into impactful posts played a key role in driving this traction and getting Qubic in front of the right audience. Not only have they supported me, but they’ve also been instrumental in elevating Qubic’s overall content presence contributing to the kind of high-level, consistent output that benefits the entire community. 

I also want to personally thank Talentnodes for his help and everyone who has supported me whether through DMs or in the general chat. Your feedback, ideas, and energy are a big part of why this content connects, and I truly appreciate it. I genuinely enjoy working with this group and look forward to continuing the collaboration as we keep building momentum together.

**Closing line**  
This is just the start. I’m committed to pushing these numbers higher and helping Qubic get the attention it deserves.

Warm regards,  
**Ryan Babel**

### **Personal Note from Ryan Babel**

To the Qubic Team,

Thank you for taking the time to review this proposal.

I would like to briefly share where I believe I can provide real value—not only as a content creator, but as someone who can help lead and activate community momentum around Qubic.

Right now, Qubic has incredible tech and a strong mission, but what’s missing is a large, consistent voice on social media—someone who posts, engages, and mobilizes the community on a daily basis. That’s where I want to step in.

I don’t like to label myself as a “KOL,” especially since many are only in it for a quick money grab and lack genuine care for the projects they promote. Unlike others, I don’t hide behind an anonymous account or online persona. My name and reputation matter, and I would never risk them on something I don’t truly believe in.

As we’ve all seen, not everyone values their image, as was the case with the previous KOL for Qubic. But I do. That said, I have a strong network in sports and among influencers. If the team ever wants to explore something with big football clubs, I can absolutely open those doors. That would be extra—above the current deal—and entirely up to the team. I don’t know your budgets or long-term plans, so I will not take that step unless it makes sense for you. Just know the network is there if needed.

In crypto, marketing is everything. Even the most advanced tech can go unnoticed without the right visibility. So I want to offer something real, honest, and collaborative.

Let’s take this step forward transparently and with intent. If things work, we continue. If not, we shake hands and part ways respectfully. That’s fair.

Let’s build.

**Best,**

**Ryan Babel**

## 

## **Overview**

Ryan Babel, former professional footballer and now a crypto enthusiast, proposes a 3-month ambassador partnership with Qubic to provide consistent, high-visibility marketing exposure, organic community engagement, and long-term value through his personal brand and network. The goal is to help rebuild Qubic’s trust in marketing efforts.

I have been in crypto since 2017\. Between 2021 and 2022, I started shifting more towards altcoins, and this past year I decided to go all in on Web3. Let me be as transparent as possible. I am NOT yet among the biggest names in the crypto space—and that actually makes this partnership even more interesting. I see several parallels between Qubic and myself, so I’ll keep it short:

1. I’ve built a solid reputation both IRL and in crypto  
2. Most influencers take easy money opportunities—I don’t  
3. I always do my own due diligence because:  
4. I only want to work with the best  
5. I want to genuinely educate my audience about solid opportunities  
6. My name is everything to me

Also, things are different now. My X (Twitter) account has the metrics to go viral. My football posts perform well, my crypto posts still have room to grow—and luckily, I have the resources to support that.

One of the key factors that will help my Qubic posts perform well is the Qubic community. I have the metrics—and over time, my mindshare on Crypto Twitter will grow, leading to more consistent engagement and reach. The Qubic community has proven that, when activated, it can boost a post’s reach using the metrics of my account.

## **The Post**

This post was not coordinated with any Qubic holders, nor did I share it in advance. I think that alone says enough. That’s all I’ll say on that.

[https://x.com/Ryanbabel/status/1922716000086048839](https://x.com/Ryanbabel/status/1922716000086048839)

This proposal is designed to initiate Qubic’s entrance into real-world and Web2-to-Web3 marketing efforts.

Let’s not ignore the elephant in the room: Qubic has had bad experiences with influencer marketing. Before jumping to conclusions, I ask you to read this proposal with an open mind. Thank you in advance.

## 

## 

## 

## **Value Offered to Qubic**

### **1\. Social Media Presence and Engagement**

1. Consistent presence on X (Twitter) with strong reach and credibility  
2. I will do my best to interact with Qubic-related content organically. I’m not trying to shill—it’s clear I believe in Qubic.  
3. I will not be doing price predictions or commenting directly on price movements.

**Commitment:**

1. 1+ Qubic post per week (graphics, commentary, 1–2 retweets)  
2. Weekly posts may include:  
3. Announcements of new features/releases  
4. Simple explanation posts for newcomers  
5. Retweets, commentary, etc.

I’ve noticed the community likes being involved. I’ll check in with them for post ideas—but ultimately, I’ll stay focused on what drives growth for Qubic.

**Engagement:**

1. I won’t just post and be done. I’ll actively engage with smaller accounts posting about Qubic and help amplify their reach.  
2. I will lead and manage a “Qubic Holders Raid Group” to encourage coordinated content creation and visibility.  
3. I could become a recognizable face for Qubic, which would help attract new users and legitimize the project.

### **2\. Community Activation**

I will launch an unofficial Telegram/X group for motivated Qubic holders to:

1. Collaborate on posts  
2. Engage with each other’s content  
3. Push key narratives together  
4. Motivate smaller accounts

**Goal:** A consistent loop of visibility and engagement.

There is already a “raid group,” but frankly, it’s an embarrassment and does not reflect well on Qubic. It’s self-evident if you check the activity. Projects with just a few million market cap are ranking in the top 10 most mentioned projects of the week due to highly active raid groups with a few hundred people and strong influencer support. What should this look like?

1. Raid group should be on **Telegram**, not Discord. Most active users on Crypto Twitter use Telegram. This is a fact—and it shows in Qubic’s current Smart Raid chat on Discord.  
2. The group needs a **leader** to guide and share posts. When people see a major account taking the lead, others will follow. It will include many small and a few large accounts. Over time, it will grow naturally—especially as the team invests more in marketing.

I’ll take the initiative, but the community and team should help invite others so we can build a strong core group of Qubic die-hards on Crypto Twitter. This will motivate people to post more, engage more, and push harder. It’s a **WIN-WIN-WIN.**

A few hundred active members can make all the difference.

Current state of the raid group channel isn't as it should be.

### **3\. Football Network Marketing Potential *(Bonus – Not part of current payment)***

Strong ties with clubs such as:

1. Galatasaray  
2. Ajax  
3. Fulham  
4. Arsenal  
5. Besiktas

If the team ever wants to explore something with major football clubs, I can open doors. Again—this would be extra, not part of the current deal.

**Potential Opportunities:**

1. Stadium LED banners or on-screen visibility  
2. Co-branded warm-up or training kits  
3. Digital collabs with club influencers or players  
4. NFT or fan token-style campaigns  
5. Football-focused AI/Web3 initiatives

I believe this could be interesting later on, after we’ve aligned on the basics. More and more clubs are working with crypto projects—and the trend is growing.

### **4\. Exchange & Industry Connections**

1. Personal relationship with Tier 1 exchange **Bybit**  
2. I’ve noticed Qubic isn’t listed on any major exchange yet. While I can’t promise listing based on personal contact alone, I do believe this could be achievable in time when aligned.

### **5\. Crypto Influencers / Project Connections**

I have many contacts in the crypto space growing by the day. Qubic is understandably cautious about KOLs, but I believe it’s important to have **trustworthy** influencers promoting Qubic. I’m connected with reliable people who could help.

This could prevent the team from hiring low-quality KOLs in the future.

Marketing is about more than just influencers—it’s about **strategic partnerships**, **collabs**, **AMAs**, and **visibility**. I’d be happy to help explore these ideas within the 3th month of the deal.

## **My Focus for the Next 3 Months**

1. Create significantly more exposure for Qubic via engagement and the raid group  
2. Lead and grow a raid group to a few hundred members  
3. Become a larger voice for Qubic on X  
4. Towards the end of the 3 months, explore:  
5. Marketing strategies  
6. Exchange listings  
7. Strategic partnerships  
8. Other high-potential opportunities

## **Spending Clarification**

The \~$11,000 monthly value in QUBIC is exclusively for:

1. Weekly posting and continuous engagement  
2. Building and managing Telegram/X communities  
3. Visibility on X where Qubic currently lacks reach  
4. Leveraging my reputation to open specific doors easier/faster.

Qubic has had almost **no official marketing**. It needs a **face**, a **voice**. I may not be the biggest—but I’m **real**, **visible**, and **trusted**. This is not just a “fee for tweets.” It’s a full,l exposure push.

## **Success Indicators**

1. Consistent visibility of Qubic on X  
2. Active, community-led engagement group under my leadership  
3. Brand discussions with football clubs  
4. Stable relationship with team and community, with potential for long-term collaboration  
5. A doxxed, respected individual promoting Qubic based on conviction

## **Terms**

1. 3-month agreement with **monthly payments** (no upfront lump sum)  
2. End of Month 1: One-time opportunity to cancel, mutually agreed  
3. If successful, we can extend or restructure  
4. All content will be tracked and shared for transparency

## 

## **Final Notes**

I understand the past, especially regarding the failed KOL relationship with Miles. That’s why I’m putting my name, time, and reputation on the line.

There’s more needed than just 3 months of partnership with me to take Qubic to the top. I know many are still affected by previous experiences—and that’s fair. But where others see risks, I see **opportunity**.

Marketing is essential—but it must be done right. I’ve seen and learned a lot in this space. I’ll use that knowledge to help avoid future mistakes and identify the right opportunities.

That’s why I’ve made it easy to opt out after Month 1 and listened to the community. I want to earn trust not just work for 3 months, but longer. Because that’s what’s really needed.

If Qubic is ready to build its public presence seriously this is the first step.

No overpromises. No hype.

Just steady, consistent work.

**Let’s make it happen.**

## **CCF 提案 Qubic × Ryan Babel**

## 请将 152 亿 QUBIC 转入以下身份地址：

## BIALNVSDAWDXUCOVZALXDHDTONNBLVVSPVMWGKUTLCAPNUQMCKJANYFCLMZM

## 用于支持 Ryan Babel 的市场推广工作。

## 选项 0：否  选项 1：是，152 亿 QUBIC

## 备注：此 CCF 提案是一个三阶段提案的一部分。本次请求涵盖第二和第三阶段，第二阶段为七月，第三阶段为八月。每个阶段都将建立在前一阶段的基础上，以便评估进展并达成一致再推进。三个阶段的总金额为 228 亿 QUBIC。

## ---

## 个人说明 – Ryan Babel

## 很难相信，我们三个月合作的第一个月已经过去了。在合作初期，我通过社区反馈和自己的研究了解到，Qubic 之前曾与一位 YouTuber/KOL 合作过，但经历并不理想。这不仅影响了团队的信任，也让整个社区对外部合作伙伴产生了质疑。

## 为了重建信任，我明确表示，我加入 Qubic 并不是为了快速获利，而是想通过行动来展示成果。鉴于之前的信任受损，这份合作必须对双方都有价值。我与团队成员进行了沟通，认真倾听了社区的担忧，并提供了灵活的合作方式：更低的起步费用、第一月内可随时终止合作、以及前提是合作确实带来价值才继续推进。

## 我很高兴地说，第一个月进展非常顺利。社区反应积极，没有任何不满的迹象。事实上，我已经做了比最初承诺更多的工作，包括发起了 Telegram Raid 群组，这比原先基于 Discord 的方式更有效。

## 我个人认为，这次我与 Qubic 的合作开局非常好。我正尽全力利用我现有的资源和人脉为项目助力，虽然这需要时间，但目前势头正盛，我想继续保持下去。

## 在 X 平台出现一些争议时，我收到很多私信问我是否会抛售所有代币，但我对 Qubic 有信心，并且看到社区是真心热情的。Talentnodes 也帮助我更好地理解了整个情况。

## 这次我请求同时拨付接下来的两个月资金，以避免再提交第三个月的提案，因为这确实会消耗一些时间。我信任 Qubic 社区。在第三个月结束后，我们可以再对齐方向并探讨新的合作方案，但现在不需要提前预设。

## 我在加密账号上发布的 Qubic 内容已累计获得超过 146,000 次展示、600 多次转发和 2,000 多次点赞。这清楚地说明，这类内容正在 Crypto Twitter 上获得关注，并成功触达核心社区之外更广泛、更活跃的受众。

## 数据也表明，当 Qubic 内容以真实、持续的方式呈现时，会激发非常积极的回应。互动不仅是被动的，社区成员也在积极评论、分享和参与讨论。

## 随着加密市场逐渐回暖，我相信这些数据只会持续上升，这一切都是对 Qubic 有利的推动。

## ---

## 社区激活

## 为了延续这一势能，我创建了一个 Telegram Raid 群组，让社区能更直接地参与。目标是围绕每一篇帖子营造热度，提升 Qubic 在加密领域的可见度。

## 我们鼓励更多成员加入进来，不仅仅是转发内容，而是主动发起讨论、吸引新关注。目前群组已有 138 名成员，我的目标是将其增长到至少 300 名活跃用户。随着 Qubic 的潜力被更多人看到，我认为这个目标完全可实现。

## 在我最初提交的提案中，我也强调了这个 Telegram 群组的重要性及其增长的作用。

## ---

## 合作致谢

## 特别感谢 @rudynakamoto 和 @m4r71n\_4r7 一直以来对内容叙事和视觉呈现的帮助。他们的创意、品质把控以及将想法转化为有影响力内容的能力，在推动传播和扩大 Qubic 曝光方面发挥了关键作用。

## 他们不仅对我个人提供了支持，也在提升整个 Qubic 内容生态方面发挥了重要作用，为整个社区带来了持续、高质量的内容输出。

## 我还要衷心感谢 Talentnodes 的协助，以及所有通过私信或在群聊中给予我支持的人。你们的反馈、建议和热情，是这些内容能够引发共鸣的重要原因，我非常感激。和大家一起合作让我很享受，也很期待我们能继续并肩前进，持续积累势能。

---

### **Ryan Babel 的个人说明**

致 Qubic 团队：

感谢大家抽出时间审阅此提案。我想简要说明，我认为我能提供的真正价值——不仅作为内容创作者，还作为能够推动并激活 Qubic 社区势能的人。

目前，Qubic 拥有出色的技术和强大的使命，但目前缺少在社交媒体上持续发声的力量——一个每天发布内容、互动并动员社区的人。我希望正是在这个方面发挥作用。

我不喜欢将自己称为“KOL”，因为很多所谓的 KOL 只是为了挣钱，对其推广项目并无真正热忱。我不像他们那样隐藏在匿名或伪装的网络身份后面。我的名字和声誉对我至关重要，我绝不会将它们押在我不真信、也不真心支持的项目上。

正如我们所见，不是每个人都重视自己的形象，尤其是之前那个与 Qubic 合作的 KOL。但我重视。因此，我拥有体育界和影响者网络。如果团队以后想在大型足球俱乐部方面开展合作，我完全可以打通这些渠道。但那属于额外内容，不在当前协议范围内，也完全由团队决定。我不了解你们的预算或长期规划，所以除非对你们有意义，否则我不会贸然前进。但如果需要，网络关系是可以搭建的。

在加密领域，营销就是一切。即使是最先进的技术，如果缺乏曝光，也可能被忽略。所以我希望提供的是实实在在、诚实且协作的帮助。

让我们以透明和目标明确的方式向前迈进。如果合作有效，我们继续；如果无效，我们握手道别。这是公平的。

让我们开始吧。

敬上，  
 **Ryan Babel**

### **概览**

Ryan Babel，前职业足球运动员，现在是一名加密爱好者，提出与 Qubic 建立为期三个月的大使合作关系，通过其个人品牌与网络提供持续且高曝光的营销推广、有机社区互动与长期价值。目标是帮助重建 Qubic 对营销合作的信任。

我从 2017 年进入加密领域。2021–2022 年期间，我逐渐转向主攻山寨币，过去一年我决定全职投入 Web3。我将尽可能透明。目前我还不是加密圈内最顶级的名字——但正因为如此，使此次合作更具吸引力。我和 Qubic 有多处相似之处，所以我简要概述如下：

* 我在线上与线下都建立了稳固的声誉

* 大部分影响者只为轻松赚钱——我不会

* 我始终自行尽职调查，因为：

  * 我只想与最优秀的合作

  * 我希望真心教育我的受众认知优质机会

  * 我的名誉对我意义重大

* 而现在情况不同了。我的 X（原 Twitter）账号具备走红潜力。我的足球内容表现良好，加密内容仍有增长空间——而且我有资源支持这一切。

推动 Qubic 帖子表现的关键因素之一是 Qubic 社区。我已经拥有数据——随着时间流逝，我在 Crypto Twitter 上的关注度将持续增长，从而带来更持续的互动和传播。Qubic 社区已经证明，一旦被激活，它能提升帖子的影响力，通过我的账号数据展现效果。

---

### **发布内容**

这条帖子并非与任何 Qubic 持有者协调，也不是提前分享。我认为这足以说明一切。就此打住。  
 [https://x.com/Ryanbabel/status/1922716000086048839](https://x.com/Ryanbabel/status/1922716000086048839)

此提案旨在启动 Qubic 的真实世界和传统 Web2 向 Web3 营销的迈进。

让我们不回避一个明显的现实：Qubic 曾在网红营销方面遭遇失败。在下结论前，我希望你们带着开放心态阅读此提案。谢谢。

---

### **Qubic 可获得的价值**

1\. 社交媒体存在感与互动

* 在 X（Twitter）上保持持续曝光和信誉

* 我会尽力有机地互动 Qubic 相关内容。我不是为了割韭菜，显然我真心看好 Qubic

* 我不会做价格预测或直接评论价格走势

承诺：每周至少一篇 Qubic 帖子（图文、评论、1–2 次转发）  
 每周发布内容可能包括：

* 新功能/发布公告

* 面向新人的简易解释帖

* 转发、评论等

社区喜欢参与互动。我会与社群确认帖子的想法，但最终专注于推动 Qubic 增长策略。

互动：我不仅发布内容，还会积极互动那些发布 Qubic 相关内容的账号，帮助提升他们的曝光率。  
 我将领导并管理“Qubic 持有者 Raid 群”，鼓励有组织的内容发布和可见度提升。  
 我可以成为 Qubic 的代言人，有助于吸引新用户并提高项目可信度。

2\. 社区激活  
 我将发起一个非官方的 Telegram/X 群组，吸引积极的 Qubic 持有者进行：

* 合作发布内容

* 互动彼此内容

* 推动核心话题

* 激励小号参与

目标是形成持续的曝光与互动循环。

目前的 raid 群组运作效果不佳，且不利于 Qubic 品牌形象。若查看实时活动，就可明了。  
 资本不大的项目也能因活跃 raid 群组与影响者支持进入周最热门提及项前十。这才是目标。  
 raid 群组应在 Telegram 而非 Discord 上建立。多数 Crypto Twitter 用户习惯使用 Telegram，这一点事实证明了这一点。  
 群组需要一个领导者来引导发布并增强可见度。当人们看到大号带头，其它人也会跟进。群组将包括大量小号和少数大号，随着团队加大营销投入，它将自然增长。  
 我会主动发起，而社区与团队也应帮助邀请更多人参与，以建立一个强大的 Crypto Twitter Qubic 核心群体，激励人们更多发布、更多互动，更积极推广。这是三赢。  
 几百名活跃成员就能产生显著作用。当前 raid 群组频道的状态远未达到应有水平。

3\. 足球网络营销潜力（附加，不在当前协议范围内）  
 与以下俱乐部联系密切：

* 加拉塔萨雷

* 阿贾克斯

* 富勒姆

* 阿森纳

* 贝西克塔斯

如果团队未来想与大型足球俱乐部开展合作，我可以打通渠道。同样——这是额外服务，不在当前协议里，并由团队决定。

潜在机会：

* 体育场 LED 广告或屏幕显示

* 联名训练服或热身装备

* 与俱乐部影响者或球员的数字合作

* NFT 或粉丝代币风格项目

* 针对足球粉丝的 AI/Web3 活动

我认为这些可能性将在我们协调基础合作之后显现。越来越多俱乐部开始与加密项目合作，这是趋势所在。

4\. 交易所与行业关系  
 我与顶级交易所 Bybit 保持私人关系。  
 我注意到 Qubic 尚未上任何大型交易所。虽然仅靠个人关系无法保证上所，但我相信在我们目标一致后这是有可能实现的。

5\. 加密影响者／项目关系  
 我在加密领域的人脉日益扩大。Qubic 对 KOL 谨慎是合理的，但我认为拥有值得信赖的影响者非常重要。我认识几位可靠的人，可以提供协助。  
 这可以避免团队未来聘请质量较低的 KOL 。

营销不只是影响者——还涵盖战略合作、联合活动、AMA 和曝光。我很乐意在第三个月内协助探索这些方向。

---

### **接下来 3 个月的重点**

* 通过互动与 raid 群组为 Qubic 创造显著曝光

* 主导并发展 raid 群组至数百成员规模

* 成为 Qubic 在 X 上更具影响力的声音

* 在三个月末，探索：

  * 营销策略

  * 交易所上线

  * 战略合作伙伴

  * 其他高潜力机会

---

### **支出说明**

约 11,000 美元的 QUBIC 每月价值仅用于：

* 每周发帖与持续互动

* 构建并管理 Telegram/X 社区

* 在 Qubic 目前缺乏覆盖的 X 平台上保持可见性

* 利用我的声誉加速或简化特定机会的实现

Qubic 几乎没有官方营销。它需要一个面孔与声音。我或许不是最大的，但我是实实在在、可见且被信任的。这不仅仅是“发布推文的费用”，而是一次全面曝光推动。

### **最后说明**

我理解过去，尤其是与 Miles 的失败 KOL 合作的背景。这就是为什么我愿意以我的名誉、时间和声望为此负责。  
 带 Qubic 登顶所需远不止三个月与我合作。我知道许多人仍对过去的经历心存顾虑——这是合理的。但别人看到风险，我看到机遇。  
 营销至关重要，但必须方式正确。我在这个领域见过并学到很多。我会利用这些经验避免未来错误，识别正确机会。  
 这就是我为何在第一个月后允许轻松退出，同时倾听社区声音。我想赢得信任，不仅是三个月，而是更长时间。因为这才是真正需要的。  
 如果 Qubic 准备认真打造自己的公众形象，这是第一步。  
 无夸张，无噱头。  
 只有稳健、持续的努力。

让我们一起实现它。
